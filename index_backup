Welcome to DaViTpy's documentation
##################################

DaViTpy is the SuperDARN Data Visualization Toolkit in Python. This documentation is as thorough as we could make it, but if you are still looking for more information, consider visiting the following sites.

* `Project page <http://vtsuperdarn.github.com/davitpy>`_ 

* `Github page <https://github.com/vtsuperdarn/davitpy>`_

* `Project wiki <https://github.com/vtsuperdarn/davitpy/wiki>`_

Contents
========

* :doc:`pydarn` : SuperDARN data analysis and visualization. Includes radar data access, radar information and fields-of-view, and standard plotting tools.

* :doc:`gme` : Geomagnetic Environement module. Includes access to other space science data-sets (POES, OMNI, TEC, ...).
   
* :doc:`models` : Useful models. Incudes empirical models (IRI, MSIS, HWM, ...), coordinate systems (AACGM, MLT), and ray-tracing.  Note that most of these routines are in C and Fortran, and do not get auto-documented.  To see documentation and example of their use, see :doc:`notebooks`.

* :doc:`utils` : Useful formatting and plotting tools, as well as a solar position calculator.

* :doc:`notebooks` : Some examples of how to use DaViTpy (IPython notebooks).

.. note:: This project is hosted on github, and we sincerely invite your to contribute!
